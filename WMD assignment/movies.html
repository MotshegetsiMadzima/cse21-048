                <h3>DONT WAKE DADDY</h3>
                <p>Don't Wake Daddy (known as SSHH! Don't Wake Dad! in the UK) is a children's board game originally released by Parker Brothers (later Milton Bradley, currently Hasbro) in North America, and Tomy in Europe (currently released by Drumond Park in the United Kingdom). It is intended for two to four players. Players take the role of children sneaking to the refrigerator late at night, trying not to wake their sleeping father (who lies in the middle of the board on a large bed). The youngest player goes first, and play continues counter-clockwise around the board. Movement is determined by using a spinner; after spinning, each player moves his/her piece to the first corresponding color. If a player gets the purple star, he/she moves to the space right in front of the leader unless he/she is already the leader; in which case he/she must spin again. </p>
